# Main settings for systems with xfce

### Install SO with xfce
I had used Xubuntu and Linux lite

### Visual Configuration

The apps I use for this are:
- dock: plank
- Ulauncher: app launcher, in xubuntu I had the "\<control> + \<space>" shortcut in linux lite is "\<control> + \<super>" (windows logo)

### Windows manager shortcuts:
- alt+Backspace: Delete window
- Super+Up: Maximize window
- Shift+Alt+Page Down: lower window
- Ctrl+Alt+Left: Move window to previus workspace
- Ctrl+Alt+Right: Move window to next workspace
- Super+Left: Tile window to the left
- Super+Right: Tile window to the Right
- Ctrl+Alt+Page Up: left workspace
- Ctrl+Alt+Page Down: Right workspace

Bonus: windows Manager Tweaks -> accessibility -> "hide title (and frame) of windows when maximazed" both are selected

### Terminal Configuration
In the terminalConfiguration there are two files:
- The .bashrc file is my bash visual configuration where I source my custom functions and I modify the ps1 variable and it's based in the xubuntu .bashrc generated script but it works in Linux lite
- The .bashrc.old is the default .bashrc script in linux lite, so is just a backup

### Vim Configuration
In the forder vimConfig you should find the README.md with the editor settings

### Git ssh configuration
soon...
